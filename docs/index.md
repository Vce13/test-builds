# MkDocs with PDF

Perform a build on Read the Docs using MkDocs and `mkdocs-with-pdf` plugin:

* [https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-with-pdf/](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-with-pdf/)

The PDF should be available to download via the flyout.
Since the flyout contains too many versions and it's not scrollable,
you can [downdload the PDF by following this link](https://test-builds.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/mkdocs-pdf/pdf/).
