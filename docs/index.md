# MkDocs with HTMLZip

Perform a build on Read the Docs using MkDocs and `mkdocs-autozip` plugin:

* [https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-autozip/](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-autozip/)

The HTMLZip should be available to download via the flyout.
Since the flyout contains too many versions and it's not scrollable,
you can [downdload the HTMLZip by following this link](https://test-builds.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/mkdocs-htmlzip/htmlzip/).
